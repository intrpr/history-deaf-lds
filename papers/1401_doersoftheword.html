	<h1>Doers of the Word, and Not Hearers Only: Early Deaf Membership of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</h1>
	<p>Elders and sisters, friends, and library staff: it’s a privilege to have a few minutes this afternoon to speak to you about a subject that is very close to me. Some of you may be whispering to each other, “Wait, isn’t he that <em>designer</em> guy who works up on the third floor?” And, yes, it is true; I have been masquerading as a web and user experience designer, deployed to the Church History Department from Publishing Services. However, I have also spent at least a decade actively researching and presenting the history of Deaf Latter-day Saints to congregations and conferences and so I’m honored to speak today about research into the history of this population of the worldwide church.</p>
	<p>I must note the absence and the irrefutable contributions of my research colleague Anne Leahy, who some of you know but who could not be here today. Our combined research and resulting projects represent a very small way that we have been able to give back to this community that has carried, nurtured, taught, and embraced us for twenty-five years. The purpose of our work has been to dig, to find, to obsess, to corroborate, to verify, and to otherwise unearth the stories and personalities of Deaf Latter-day Saints that “cry out from the dust.” It has been our aim to return these histories back to their rightful owners.</p>
	
	<h2>Contexting</h2>
	<p>At the outset, I want to spend just a moment contexting some terms because, in this domain of Deaf cultural studies, terminology and labels are lexically wanting but semantically rich and carry far more weight than can be properly communicated. Here, the historical terms “deaf-mute,” “deaf and dumb,” or “mutes” which Deaf people of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century were regularly called, are analogous to the contemporary term “Deaf.” Though “deaf-mute” and “deaf and dumb” are, without doubt, anachronistic and extremely offensive today, Anne and I have maintained historicity in our work where necessary because the people about whom we are narrating used these labels themselves.</p> 
	<p>And, while the modern descriptor “American Sign Language” or “ASL” has been in use since the 1960s, during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, neither these terms nor any of their associated political connotations existed. The roughly historical equivalent term during that time period would have been “signs” or “the sign language.”</p> 
	<p>By and large, the American Deaf community uses “Deaf” (rendered in American Sign Language like this: DEAF) <em>not</em> as an audiological designation, but a cultural and linguistic identifier, the way a person might self-identify “I am Chinese” or “I am Hispanic.” Viewed from the center of contemporary <em>Deaf</em> discourse, ‘deaf’ and ‘hearing,’ function less as commentary on a person’s audiology and more as social labels. In this particular domain of research, then, Anne and I are not chronicling the experiences of “old Uncle Brigham” or “Aunt Eliza” who lost their hearing later in life, but of those who were part of established American Deaf communities and who espoused the use of a signed language.</p>
	<p>Additionally, world Deaf communities reject the use of ‘hearing impaired,’ viewing it as a pejorative commentary on ability and the intentional reframing of something they do not do. To draw a somewhat asymmetrical analogy, Black people typically do not frame themselves as ‘unable to be white.’</p>
	<p>All of these distinctions are important because the historical narrative of Deaf Latter-day Saints is not based in a framework of <em>dis</em>ability, or the inability to hear, but instead in the community of <em>ability</em>, or the value of common language and experience.</p>

	<h2>Methodology</h2>
	<p>A quick word about our research methodologies. Primary sources about Deaf Latter-day Saint converts from this time period are extremely rare. Though formal Deaf education in the United States became entrenched in the late 1810s, and was actually widely considered to be superior to the public education offered non-Deaf students of the time (Deaf students typically entered school around age six or seven and graduated in their early twenties), the first generation of Deaf Mormon converts were mostly raised either too early for or outside of formalized literacy. The second generation grew up in the periphery around adobe and wagons and handcarts. Personal written memoirs are nearly nonexistent. Anne and I have reconstructed handfuls of biographies by stitching together secondary and derivative narratives, government documentation, and mentions in public and Church newspapers and periodicals.</p>
	<p>In looking for records of early Deaf Latter-day Saints, we have reviewed every federal and state census enumeration for Utah, Illinois, Iowa, Nebraska, and New York between 1830 and 1900. As many of you know, mid-century federal census records included a column indicating deafness; and results of the 1880 federal census were publicly posted in an August 1886 <em>Deseret News</em> issue as a call for students to enroll in the newly-established Territorial School for the Deaf at the University of Deseret.</p>
	<p>Serendipitously, state governments require that annual reports of state residential schools for the Deaf render an account of student entry, matriculation, and exit; alumni records and school censuses of deaf students and local deaf citizenry have helped to triangulate our collections. We have spun through reels upstairs to connect school enrollment with Church membership records, and then have worked backwards and sideways. And we have begged our way into the lives of hearing descendants who have been gracious to grant interviews and access to their family records. Maybe some of you here today are beneficiaries or trustees of these types of records as well.</p>

	<h2>Re-centering Deaf Worship</h2>
	<p>The pseudonymous New Testament letter The Book of James admonishes first-century Christians to “...be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only,” (KJV James 1:22) which is, to be sure, a clever reference in a paper about <em>Deaf</em> Latter-day Saints, but more importantly, it’s a pointed commentary on the active versus passive nature of worship. What are the expectations of worship and liturgy? What are <em>your</em> expectations of worship and liturgy? If scripture commands that our prayers be vocal (cf. <a href="http://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/ps/55.17?lang=eng#16">Psalms 55:17</a>), is the inference that they are less effectual if they are not?</p>
	<p>Admittedly, the God of my adolescence was exactly like me: Western European (if not ruggedly Teutonic or Scandinavian), English-speaking, and possessed of an acutely perfect sense of hearing; after all, I was taught, by leaders who only had a framework for one kind of worship, that my prayers and petitions were to be heard of the Lord.</p>
	<p>But just a few years later, then as a missionary serving the Deaf and signed-language-using population of the Pacific Northwest, I sat across the room from my new Deaf companion late into the night discussing how <em>his</em> prayers and <em>his</em> petitions were received by <em>his</em> God. He confessed that he felt His Heavenly Father was much like mine — the creator of all things — and yet I wondered at how he felt about his own ontology and eschatology. I wondered if he thought his supplication was less productive than mine.</p>
	<p>Deafness, especially during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, was often accompanied with the perception that it is a deficit, a <em>lack</em> of ability, and a <em>lack</em> of sense. As this long-held Aristotelian ideology — equating the lack of hearing with an inability to learn — was institutionalized by philosophers, educators, and clergy of the late 1800s, they considered deafness to be a moral and cognitive constraint. For all the reports and histories of their many abilities and exploits in the arts and technology, narratives constructed about deaf people of this time period still tinted them as “pathetic,” “ignorant,” “unfortunate,” and “deprived.”</p>
	<p>Eugenic experimentation on Deaf people into the new century ranged from actual bodily manipulation to the lobbying for a legal prohibition of Deaf intermarriage in order to eradicate the condition altogether. In the early Latter-day Saint tradition, church members and leaders reconciled deafness by invoking Biblical admonitions, such as Isaiah 35 and Matthew 11, to “heal” and “cause the...deaf to hear.” Until they were made “whole,” however, Deaf people were considered to be perpetual recipients of charity, and consequently, if divine appeals were successful, instruments to solely glorify God (cf. Matthew 15).</p>
	<p>From <em>their</em> perspective, however, confronted with nonnative versions of worship, Deaf parishioners viewed and defined their relationships with Deity and salvation from <em>their</em> center and not from the periphery of others. Deaf Protestant congregations in mid-nineteenth century New York City and Victorian Britain thrived when <em>their</em> experiences were placed at the center. Hearing ministers and clergymen of these churches adamantly maintained that religious services for Deaf parishioners be “conducted in Sign Language .... arguing that it was a language entitled to respect and dignity in its own right.”</p>
	
	<h2>Deaf Latter-day Saint Proto-community Worship Spaces: 1830s–1890s</h2>
	<p>Prior to the last decade of the nineteenth century, Deaf Latter-day Saints were still largely situated within wards, branches, and auxiliaries that communicated in a spoken modality. While there are a handful of early Deaf Latter-day Saint conversion, overland pioneer travel, and post-Exodus narratives alongside the much-better-known analogs of their hearing brothers and sisters, they are fewer and far less recognized. One example is that of Elizabeth Garner, a fourteen-year-old British emigrant, but for the grace of researcher insomnia — and a little touch of Elijah — was consigned only to be remembered as the “deaf and dumb girl [who] died in our camp today,” as recorded in an 1866 overland trail journal. Leaders and relatives typically denied any unmet needs, or assumed that Deaf congregants “just enjoyed partaking of the spirit,” still an oft-reported outsider view of the Deaf Latter-day Saint experience today.</p>
	<p>Our survey of census and LDS records between 1830–1880, however, reveals Deaf Church members actively being baptized, traveling overland, receiving temple ordinances, and entering into temple marriages with non-Deaf spouses. The convergence of people arriving from Europe to settle the Utah Territory included Deaf pioneers and émigrés who brought with them the national signed languages and educational background they attained in their countries of origin.</p>
	<p>The earliest-known Deaf Latter-day Saint conversions occurred in 1832 and 1835, both defined by the worldviews, actions, and framework of their well-meaning non-deaf relatives and both terminating with their protagonists never joining fellow Saints — deaf or otherwise — in Utah nor meaningfully contributing to the nascent Deaf Latter-day Saint community. The first and only-known attempt of pre-Exodus Deaf temple worship took place in 1846 but there is no record that the experience was in any way tailored to fit the visual needs of a Deaf participant. And until late 1889, given Latter-day Saint perspectives on marriage and disability, frontier pragmatism, and general attitudes toward Deaf endogamy, any marriage or solemnization involving Deaf Latter-day Saints were always to non-deaf spouses; Deaf women in particular were fairly common choices for polygamous families.</p>  
	<p>In essence, without architectural, logistical, operational, or even linguistic subspaces in which to develop and grow, any sort of Deaf Latter-day Saint experience was held out of the starting gate at least by seventy years.</p>
	
	<h2>The Deaf-Mute Sunday School (1892–1917)</h2>
	<p>All of this changed, however, in January 1892, when “...a Sunday School [for students boarding at the school for the Deaf at the University of Deseret,] was organized January 10, 1892, with a membership of eleven boys and sixteen girls....[They] marched to the 19th Ward Relief Society room, Mr. Metcalf [, the School’s non-Mormon superintendent] kindly assisting as interpreter...” Though this initial bellwether event represents the first time dedicated physical worship spaces were used by a Deaf Latter-day Saint congregation, at its outset, this was still a provision for — and not initiated by or of — Deaf parishioners. </p> 
	<p>For the first four years of the Sunday School in Salt Lake City (and for at least the next four years in their new location in Ogden), meetings were nearly totally interpreted by Principal Metcalf and mediated by Assistant Superintendent Laron Pratt, a self-described ‘semi-mute’ Deseret News typesetter and sole faithful son of Latter-day Saint apostle Orson and Sarah Bates Pratt. (Parenthetically, Anne and I surmise that it was because of Laron’s deafness that he was shielded from Sarah’s irascibility, especially towards his father, and remained faithful to the restored Gospel.)</p> 
	<p>Initially, Deaf students and visitors to the Deaf-Mute Sunday School were not afforded the expected symmetry and parity they might have seen in the worship services of their non-Deaf peers and family. Sacramental prayers were spoken vocally while Deaf congregants passively followed along with the prayer on printed cards. Nor, at the opening of the Sunday School, did Deaf students and visitors directly participate in prayers and hymn-singing either, although eventually these were later — albeit passive — provisions:</p>
	<blockquote>“Both the prayer and song are...interpreted as the praying and singing proceeds into the sign language, and the students are greatly interested in the interpretation.”</blockquote>
	<p>As the Sunday School matured, however, Deaf Latter-day Saints began to be empowered in magnifying their own eschatology and priesthood and leadership roles. The plasticity and laboratory of the Deaf-Mute Sunday School allowed Deaf church members to explore their own analogs to the Latter-day Saint experience:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>How do Deaf people lead and conduct meetings?</li>
		<li>What does the sacrament look like when it is blessed in sign language? What is salient in the translation of the ordinance?</li>
		<li>How should Deaf priesthood holders reconcile the Biblical and Latter-day Saint mandate of “laying on of hands” while giving a blessing in a manual language?</li>
		<li>How should Deaf Latter-day Saints incorporate or embrace the broader Mormon tradition of hymnody? How should the genetics of church music — notes, rhythm, tune, meter, lyrics — be represented?</li>
	</ul>
		
	<h2>Personal and Spiritual Efficacy</h2>
	<p>Extant records from 1892 to 1901 are silent on how priesthood ordinances were performed within the context of regular meetings. At its beginning, the Sunday School was mostly administered and interpreted by non-Deaf leaders in behalf of the Deaf members of the School.</p>
	<p>However, the meticulously-kept records of the Sunday School beginning in 1902 — which are held in this building — indicate that, at some point, Deaf priesthood holders actively participated in the passing of the sacrament to its members. In the September 28, 1902 minutes of the Sunday School, it was recorded that “Second assistant Supt. [J. P.] Bush <em>signed</em> the opening prayer” and that “the sacrament of the Lord’s supper was administered in the sign language by Elders Earl Moore and Nephi Larson.” Perhaps seen as a footnote, but these notations are significant for Deaf Latter-day Saints because they appear to be the first recorded instances of priesthood ordinances performed in ‘the sign language’ in this dispensation. This record marks a revolution in the ability of Deaf priesthood holders to act personally—rather than nonparticipatively—in the use of their priesthood.</p>
	<p>Following Superintendent Fred Chambers’ appointment in 1902, signed language interaction and administration began to figure more prominently in the Sunday School’s dealings. In October 1907, the Ogden Stake Sunday School Board reorganized the Sunday School superintendency and appointed three fluent sign language users to the posts. Over the remaining ten years of the Sunday School and the first few years of the Branch that followed, with the exception of the Superintendent and one assistant/counselor, all available leadership positions were extended to capable Deaf Latter-day Saints who had been trained by their formative experiences in the Sunday School.</p>

	<h2>Administrative Patterning</h2>
	<p>The School required leaders and members to develop adaptations to the correlated mechanisms of the at-large Church as they conducted meetings, enacted pedagogy, recontexted musical worship, and administered the sacrament.</p>
	<p>For almost the first ten years of the Deaf-Mute Sunday School, meeting proceedings were conducted primarily in spoken English and interpreted by Principal Metcalf.  By 1902, though, ‘the sign language’ appears to have taken on a much more substantial role in their worship. In the minutes of the September 28, 1902 Sunday School alone, after Superintendent Chambers called the meeting to order, “Second Assiant[sic] Supt. J.P. Bush <em>signed</em> the opening prayer.” Where once songs were sung vocally and prayers and remarks spoken aloud, now the “sacrament was administered <em>in the sign language,</em>” “...Supt. Chambers <em>signed</em> on the subject of ‘Faith and Prophet Joseph Smith’s life,” “The closing prayer was offered <em>in the sign language,</em>” “All the singing was led and <em>signed</em>...,” and monthly signed testimony meetings become a regular fixture.</p>
	<p>With the superintendency and teacher corps becoming more bilingual, Second Assistant J. P. Bush, and instructor Max Woodbury began to figure more prominently in the Sunday School. Bush was not a native signer but he was an instructor and coach at the Utah School and conversant in sign language. And Woodbury was learning sign language as quickly as he could; by October 1902 he was offering prayers, blessing the sacrament, teaching primary and secondary Sunday School classes, providing interpretation for talks, and mastering ‘the sign language’ well enough to magnify the callings in which he would serve for the next sixty-five years.</p>
	<p>As the conducting of meetings began shifting away from spoken English to a signed language, alterations to traditional Mormon worship began to appear. Standards of reverence were enforced; Pratt admonished the children “that they must not talk while the Sacrament was administered.” By 1903, accompaniment was considered nonessential and hymns were, as mentioned previously, “led and signed” by various members of the Sunday School.</p>
	<p>In the 1907–1908 school year, the Sunday School adopted the correlated Sunday School meeting program report form. Beginning in November 1907, the words ‘Concert Recitation’ were struck out on the form and the words ‘Thot[sic] Development’ overwritten, followed by the title of a hymn. Judging from later minutes, it is likely that “thots” were remarks and teachings based on the hymn’s text. What Latter-day Saints might now call a “spiritual thought” was not confined to music, as minutes record that the close of the meetings “also had as a thot development exercise the first article of our faith.”</p>


	<h2>Social Sanctuaries</h2>

	<p>Finally, the Deaf-Mute Sunday School fostered new marital possibilities for deaf Latter-day Saints who had historically either married non-deaf spouses or worked as extended family caretakers or farmhands. Because the Sunday School extended leadership opportunities in an environment conducive to sociality and courting, several Deaf-led families reinvigorated local municipalities with their educational, vocational, and ecclesiastical experience.</p>

	<p>In 1884, the University of Deseret Deaf-Mute Department was founded on a boarding/residential school model successful in other state institutions, which not only advanced pupils’ intellectual growth, but also provided for personal development and social interaction, far more than would have been possible by attendance at a day school in a local community.</p>

	<p>Former classmates Hugh Jacob and Isabella West were sealed in the Manti Temple in December 1889, having graduating from the Utah School that same year. This union is significant to Deaf Latter-day Saints because it is the first recorded temple solemnization of two Deaf spouses.</p>

	<p>If the school for the Deaf provided the garden for sociality, then the Deaf-Mute Sunday School supplied the soil where Deaf Latter-day Saint young adults could interact, court, marry, and raise families in a Mormon context. Of the first twenty-five marriages between Latter-day Saint couples who met at the Utah School for the Deaf during the time of the Sunday School, seventeen were solemnized in Latter-day Saint temples, and an additional four couples returned to be sealed.</p>

	<p>The Sunday School allowed its members to nurture pedagogical and experiential analogs to their non-Deaf brothers and sisters. They came to learn — and expect — that the work of salvation ‘in the sign language’ was just as equivalent in their God’s eyes and that their Sunday School would prepare them for mental and spiritual sojourns away from the Deaf Latter-day Saint community.</p>

	<p>Originally a passive, vicarious, mediated ritual, Deaf Latter-day Saints, empowered by supportive administrators, reengineered their worship, their priesthood ministrations, and their service in callings into an active, collaborative, and personally potent experience. Twenty-first century Deaf Latter-day Saints are the beneficiaries of the Sunday School’s quarter-century-long remarkable experiment in the alignment of their worship spaces, which left a heritage of an organizational structure, the development of members’ personal and spiritual efficacy, patterns of administrative norms, and the School as social sanctuary.</p>


	<h1>Converts and Personalities</h1>

	<p>Often as precedents for or adjuncts to the chronology of Deaf Mormons are reconstructed biographies knitted together from the records of contemporaries and descendants. The first conversion stories and mentions of Deaf Latter-day Saints in the Restoration are faith-promoting and inspiring, yet complex and incomplete. In a few cases, the stories have suffered from error or the perpetuation of mythology; Anne and I have sought to repair the currently-published accounts of these Saints and bring some closure to their untold chapters. Additionally, I share here the experiences of three other lives, unknown to one another, yet representative of other Deaf Latter-day Saints of the same time period.</p>

	<h2>Charity Skeen</h2>

	<p>In the spring of 1835, Mormon missionaries arrived in Simpson County, Tennessee and converted and baptized twenty-two souls. On March 1, 1835, John Lowe Butler invited the Mormon elders into his home and allowed them to preach “the first principles as set down in the New Testament.” John and his wife Caroline were baptized into the faith eight days later on March 9, 1835; John’s mother, realizing she had put off baptism, also requested the elders’ services. But the elders also had another interested party:</p>

	<blockquote>“Now my wife's [Caroline Farozine Skeen] sister, Charity was deaf and dumb and, hearing the fuss that was made about the Mormons, she came to my wife and asked her the meaning of it all, and my wife told her as well as she could by signs...that it was the true and everlasting gospel that they preached.... The Lord...opened her understanding and she told my wife that she would be baptized too, by the man sent of God, but my wife told her that she had better not as her father was very much opposed to Mormonism..., but Charity persisted in being baptized....”</blockquote>

	<p>Caroline’s concern that her father would be antagonistic to Charity’s excitement about her new faith proved to be accurate; an overprotective father and brothers would not allow Charity to accompany John and Caroline to the Mormon settlements in Missouri and Illinois. Seven years later, in the fall of 1842, now a missionary, Butler “...visited my friends in Tennessee, and found them bitter opponents against the Church....” To his surprise, however, John “found my wife’s sister, Charity, still clinging to the kingdom of God, and wanting to go home with me to Nauvoo[, Illinois] but her brothers tried to stop her from going with me.”</p>

	<p>For all the animus of her family toward her decision and complete lack of access to religious instruction, Charity, like Jacob of old, patiently waited seven years for the object of her faith, and was reunited with her sister Caroline just after the beginning of the new year. In one of the first public instances of plural marriage during the Church’s Nauvoo era (JMH article on polygamy in Nauvoo for reference), Charity was sealed to John Lowe Butler on December 23, 1844 and the three of them served missions to Iowa and South Dakota between 1844 and 1846.</p>

	<p>In late 1847, Butler recorded that Charity’s brother traveled to Illinois with instructions to return her home to their Tennessee family. Butler’s biographer William Hartley writes that Charity “died there [in Tennessee] among her Skeen relatives,” however, it is, in fact, her younger sister Polly’s 1854 death date that is mistakenly assigned to Charity.</p>

	<p>Research of federal census and state Deaf school records shows Charity quite alive and living in Kentucky as late as 1858, then Sumner County, Tennessee in 1860, in Simpson County, Kentucky again in 1870, and eventually with her brother in Nebraska as late as 1885.  Charity never traveled to the Utah Territory and it is unlikely that she ever met any other Deaf Latter-day Saints, yet her dedication to her faith despite familial and linguistic obstacles is an important chapter in the Deaf Mormon narrative.</p>


	<h2>Sarah Eckersley (Crompton) Robinson</h2>

	<p>Born February 15, 1844 in Oldham, Lancashire, the fourth daughter of William and Hannah Hardy Eckersley, Sarah Eckersley, her convert parents, and three sisters emigrated to the United States in January 1845, eventually arriving in St. Louis after a six-week sea voyage aboard the traveling ship <em>Palmyra</em>. The voyage was difficult and Sarah became ill; shortly into her illness, her parents noticed that Sarah did not respond to ambient sounds. From the deck of the ship, William shot his pistol in the air, intending for Sarah to respond. When Sarah made no reply, her parents realized that she had lost her hearing.</p>

	<p>William died during the winter of 1847 in St. Louis; in 1850, Hannah joined westward-bound Saints in Winter Quarters and Kanesville where she met and married John Crompton. Nine-year-old Sarah and her family joined the 1854 Henry Ettleman Company; forty people and eleven wagons left the Keokuk outfitting post on July 1 and arrived in Salt Lake City on October 1. Once her family arrived in the Deseret Territory, the Cromptons lived for a short time at Cottonwood, later at Camp Floyd, and then finally settled in Lake City (now American Fork) in 1860. Sarah was the first known Deaf Latter-day Saint to settle in Utah County.</p>

	<p>An attractive slight woman with black hair and blue eyes, Sarah was meticulous about maintaining a visual environment of order and natural beauty and people loved her genuine good nature; she enjoyed going to socials and was popular at dances. Sarah became the second wife to William Robinson on December 15, 1867 in the Endowment House; in the 1870 Federal census, she is listed living alone with their first child. After William’s first wife died, Sarah willingly cared for his seven children, eventually adding five more of their own.</p>

	<p>Sarah possessed a remarkable instinct to sense when her children were stirring or when danger was near. Her neighbors were consistently amazed at how, though they themselves hadn’t heard a noise, Sarah would intuitively scurry off to tend to an awakened child. Another time, her children recollected that upon returning home one day, Sarah “sensed” the presence of someone in the house. As she quietly stepped to her bed and looked under, Sarah found an intruder crouched and waiting for her. Ill-prepared for a beating at the hands of an armed housewife, she whacked the man repeatedly with a broom and chased the scoundrel from the house, beating him as she gave chase.</p>

	<p>In 1871, at a time when membership was determined by character and contribution, Sarah was admitted to the American Fork Relief Society. Her contributions of soap and clothing were meager but were the measure of her own ‘widow’s mite.’ While she was probably adept at some measure of lipreading, Sarah’s deafness was an asset to her family; she taught signed language to her friends, neighbors, and family, and created unique methods for identifying and calling to her children. Despite ward members’ inability to understand her language, Sarah “gleaned a remarkable spirit by her attendance at church” and it was said of her that her spirituality and strength far outbalanced any inability to hear a sermon.</p>


	<h2>John Sherratt</h2>

	<p>ohn Sherratt, the reluctant pioneer, was born to Sara Godwin and Smith Sherratt at Scholargreen, Cheshire on January 23, 1828. Between eighteen and twenty-four months, John contracted scarlet fever which caused his deafness. Educated at home, a proficient communicator, and “adept in using sign language,” when John was eighteen years old, he, stepfather Thomas D. Brown, and mother Sara were baptized into the Church in December 1846 by Elder Orson Hyde.</p>

	<p>John published his conversion experience in the British Latter-day Saint newspaper <em>The Millennial Star</em> under the headline “Reflections of a Deaf and Dumb Young Man.” John shared his personal experience which lead him to an understanding of the Church — “I was dreaming about being baptized, and an angel led me out. I wish to be good and obey God and my parents, and love the Mormons and the Bible, and to have care to be good” — and of an understanding of his deafness —”The Bible says that God can give to hear and speak, even the deaf and dumb. God made me deaf and dumb....I am glad I was baptized.”</p>

	<p>Sometime in 1849 or 1850, the Sherratt family and stepfather Brown began their emigration to Salt Lake City; the Sherratt family appears in the 1850 federal census in Pottawattamie County (interestingly enough, in the same census district as six-year-old Sarah Eckersley). John was twenty-four years old when the family left Kanesville in July 1852 to travel with the 230-person, 130-wagon Robert Wimmer Company. Although John is strangely not recorded as travelling with his family, he and the company arrived in Salt Lake City on September 15, 1852.</p>

	<p>In April 1854, John and his stepfather were called on missions by President Brigham Young to Old Fort Harmony. President Young thought that “John, able and adept with sign language, would make a good missionary to send to the Indians.” Elder Sherratt was the first Deaf Latter-day Saint to serve a full-time mission for the Church, and it would be another one hundred and twelve years before another Deaf elder or sister would be formally called to serve a full-time proselyting mission. Though President Young was likely well-intentioned, sending a British Deaf man to communicate with the Paiutes was much like expecting a Japanese national to be natively fluent in Chinese, and Sherratt was released a year later. John moved to Fort Cedar City in 1855, the first of many Deaf Latter-day Saints to settle in Iron County (Cedar City) and Southern Utah beginning in the 1860s.</p>

	<p>Sherratt taught the manual alphabet to his new community and quickly made friends with residents of the fort. Despite a privileged and educated upbringing, John worked hard to pioneer, build, farm, raise livestock, and homestead (he is listed in the 1870 federal Iron County census as a farmer), some years less successful than others. John was more successful at the part-time and odd-job bookkeeping and accounting jobs he was asked to do, mostly because of his penmanship and tutoring he had received at a young age. John and his wife Christina had nine children (one was stillborn, one died at five months) between 1856 and 1881. </p>

	<p>Sherratt left a pioneer’s legacy to his family and to Deaf Latter-day Saints of faith, self-confidence, and a love for his God-given station in life. John was known to dress in his Sunday best and attended church weekly in his Cedar City ward, doing his best to understand each speaker. It is said that John regularly demonstrated his faithfulness and bore “his testimony quite often, standing tall and proud, his expressive hands carrying his message of humble gratitude to a congregation who understood and admired him.” John proudly taught his children and grandchildren sign language, “danc[ing them] on his knees, tenderly guid[ing] their small hands in forming the letters of his language.”</p>


	<h2>Fidelia Shamp</h2>

	<p>There are few details, unfortunately, in the curious case of Fidelia Shamp, and her initial experience with the laying on of hands is not unlike others reported during the early days of Latter-day Saint missionary work. Born in 1836, what we have of young Fidelia’s experience was chronicled by her parents in an August 1841 Times and Seasons:</p>

	<blockquote>“Batavia, N. Y. May 19th, 1841.<br><br>To the Saints scattered abroad, and to all whom it may concern: Greeting.<br><br>Be it known that on or about the first of December, last, we J[oseph]. Shamp and Margaret Shamp of the town of Batavia, Gennessee County, N. Y. had a daughter that had been deaf and dumb four and a half years, and was restored to her hearing the time aforesaid by the laying on of the hands of the elders of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day[sic] Saints, commonly called Mormons, through the power of Almighty God, and faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, as believed and practiced by them in these last days.”<br><br>“The circumstance attending her restoration were these. It was asked, as a sign in a meeting of the Latter Day Saints by an Elder of the Babtist[sic] Church of the name of Stimson in an insolent manner and he said if they would heal the child, he would be a Mormon, and he would guarantee that the whole congregation would be Mormons too. When the sign was asked, it was manifest to me by the spirit of God, that if I would believe and obey the fullness[sic] of the gospel it should be done. Soon after we had obeyed the gospel, [the] Elders Nathan R. Knight and Charles Thompson came to our house, and they administered to her by the laying on of hands and she was restored to her hearing, and now she both hears and speaks and is improving very fast in talking...”</blockquote>

	<p>If this presentation today is about <em>Deaf</em> Latter-day Saints, why, then, would we include Fidelia in this narrative? Because, only until a little over a year ago, although the story seems to begin and end in a two column newspaper article, additional triangulation and research into Fidelia’s life reveals that she was actually Deaf for the rest of her known life.</p>

	<p>1840 and 1850 federal census records indicate Fidelia — enumerated as “Deaf &#38; dumb” — lived in the family home, but by her late adolescence in the mid-1850s, she was enrolled in formal education at the New York School for the Deaf. Fidelia blossomed while at school, receiving recognition each term and even earning accolades for her artwork. Unfortunately, after 1860, her whereabouts and her family’s ultimate church activity are currently unknown.</p>

	<p>To be clear, this truthtelling of Fidelia’s story is <em>not</em> intended to be commentary on the efficaciousness of priesthood blessings. The might and power of God has clearly been made manifest in healings and the stemming of physical ailments; no doubt, each of you here has had personal witness to Providential cures. What are we, then, to make Fidelia’s case? There is likely some kind of audiologic and scientific explanation for the story, but research and personal experience has taught me that the lives and contributions of Deaf Latter-day Saints are just as important as all of the others of God’s children. Put more succinctly by John Sherratt: “<em>God</em> made me deaf.” And just as the healing of those who have infirmities — don’t we all have infirmities, really? — is intended to testify that “the works of God should be made manifest,” so also is a life magnified. God needs Deaf people too.</p>

	<p>Though Sarah and John landed in the Deseret Territory, they, like handfuls of other Deaf Latter-day Saints in the late nineteenth century, did not enjoy the sociality of typical Mormon association, Gospel citizens but treated as expatriates in their own land. With the founding of the residential Territorial School for the Deaf in 1884 and the Deaf-Mute Sunday School in 1892, however, the fulfillment of Abinadi’s injunction “that the salvation of the Lord shall be declared to every nation, kindred, tongue, and people” was underway, and Deaf Latter-day Saints began to be afforded — and take — opportunities to learn and lead.</p>


	<h2>Elsie Christiansen</h2>

	<p>On an October afternoon in 1907, Elsie Christiansen, a seventeen-year-old senior and five-foot-ten-inch standout on the girls’ basketball team at the Utah School for the Deaf, stood up in her pew in the Ogden Fourth Ward building just around the corner from her school. In an appropriate and familiar gesture, Elsie’s leaders and peers raised their hands and sustained her as the new secretary and treasurer for her congregation, the Latter-day Saint Deaf-Mute Sunday School. Born in Riverton, Utah during the same summer that her school was first founded in 1884, Elsie’s new responsibility would be the first of many over the next fifty years of her professional and ecclesiastical career in Ogden at the school and in the community that would come to view her as a teacher, a confidant, and role model.</p>

	<p>When the Sunday School superintendency was reorganized in January 1911, Elsie was sustained as the first assistant to the newly-called superintendent, Max Woodbury. This important association between Woodbury, the Sunday School’s senior teacher and leader, and Christiansen, his tutor, confidant, and counselor, would inform the School’s direction for the next six years and help transition it from a weekly gathering of church members to a vital and empowered religious community of Deaf brothers and sisters, the first of its kind in the Latter-day Saint tradition.</p>

	<p>By late 1911 and early 1912, Christiansen was advising Superintendent Woodbury on the need for a dedicated worship space and meetinghouse for Deaf church members. The two would collaborate on a series of correspondence to Church president Joseph F. Smith, explaining the need to leverage architectural features such as sloped chapel floors to enable Deaf congregants to see speakers more clearly and the removal of popular highbacked classroom seating in favor of a more visually-friendly semicircle of desks.</p>

	<p>Elsie wore many hats during her tenure in the Sunday School: she taught intermediate classes and shepherded the spiritual development of the young women. In contrast to the traditional mothers of her congregation, Elsie filled a different yet much-needed mothering role in which she intermingled linguistics and leadership, signs and service. After their new building was completed in late 1916 and the Sunday School became the Church’s first-ever unit dedicated for Deaf signing members in February 1917, Elsie was called as its first clerk, a place she would fill for the next thirty-two years. In a role historically filled by men in the Latter-day Saint tradition, Elsie’s attention to detail was indispensable to the branch’s maturity; her written notes and recollections serving as its texture and voice for the first half of the twentieth century.</p>


	<h1>Conclusion</h1>

	<p>There is, of course, much, much more to the story. There are buildings and there are branches, missions and ministries. There is an 1832 conversion account which we have not yet reconciled. And there is still the story of the Edwardian Britain harvest and the World War II-era gathering of Deaf Saints in Southern California to tell. There are the stories of four young Deaf elders called on missions in 1968 which made possible my mission experience twenty-two years ago. Hopefully, observing the interwoven events and narratives of these early Saints challenges all of us to recontext how we see Deaf people in the Latter-day Saint tradition. On one hand, these stories may feel familiar and unremarkable: nearly everyone has a great-great-grand-somebody who experienced hardships on a fill-in-the-blank frontier journey. But on the other hand, these narratives are remarkable because, given their time and context and the framework in which they were viewed by non-Deaf people, they shouldn’t have happened.</p>

	<p>These first generations of Deaf Latter-day Saints charted new territories and recontexted familial, social, and eschatological spaces for modern-day Saints, not <em>despite</em> their deafness, but <em>because</em> of it. Thank you.</p>
