	<h1>120 Years of Deaf Latter-day Saint Spaces</h1>
	<p>The pseudonymous New Testament letter <em>The Book of James</em> admonishes first-century Christians to “...be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only,” (KJV James 1:22) to be sure, a clever reference in a paper about <em>Deaf</em> Latter-day Saints, but more importantly, a pointed commentary on the active versus passive nature of worship. What are the expectations of worship and liturgy? What are <em>your</em> expectations of worship and liturgy? If scripture commands that our prayers be vocal (cf. <a href="http://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/ps/55.17?lang=eng#16">Psalms 55:17</a>), is the inference that they are less efficacious if they are not?</p>
	<p>Presumptuously, the God of my adolescence was exactly like me: Western European (if not ruggedly Teutonic or Scandinavian), English-speaking, and possessed of an acutely perfect sense of hearing; after all, I was taught, by leaders who only understood one kind of worship framework, that my prayers and petitions were to be <em>heard</em> of the Lord.</p>
	<p>But just a few years later, then as a missionary called specifically to serve the Deaf and signed-language-using population of the Northwestern United States, I sat across the room from my Deaf companion discussing how <em>his</em> prayers and <em>his</em> petitions were received by <em>his</em> God. He confessed that he felt His Heavenly Father was much like mine — admittedly, the master of sound — and yet I wondered at how he felt about his own liturgy, his own eschatology. I wondered if he believed his supplication was less productive than mine.</p> 
	<p>I asked the question to which I most naïvely wanted an answer. Perhaps he knew this was coming, as most Deaf people do. “If you could take a pill,” I asked, genuinely yet intrusively, “that would make you hearing, would you do it?” Instead of getting the answer I expected, he simply replied, “What <em>is</em> hearing?”</p>
	<p>Wayne Morris has observed that a relationship with an invisible God is less unnatural for non-Deaf people, who are accustomed to communicating in such a way.<sup><a href="#001">1</a></sup> For 120 years, Deaf Latter-day Saints have confronted typical or expected conventions of worship by observing, adapting, then revising, and finally creating a wholly Deaf LDS space. The physical and symbolic centers of a Deaf-led and visually-based body of Saints are the remarkable customized chapels where the first congregations met. This presentation will trace those spaces conceived, built, and celebrated by the Deaf community, which fostered architectural and liturgical “diversit[ies] of operations” (D&#38;C 46:16) that have become today’s unquestioned standard.</p>
	
	<h1>Contexting Terminologies</h1>
	<p>I spend a moment in contexting some terms because, in this domain of Deaf cultural studies, terminology and labels are lexically weak but semantically rich and carry far more weight than can be properly communicated. Here, the historical terms “deaf-mute,” “deaf and dumb,” or “mutes” which Deaf people of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century were regularly called, are analogous to the contemporary term “Deaf.” Though “deaf-mute” and “deaf and dumb” are anachronistic and offensive today, we choose to maintain historicity where necessary here because the people about whom we are narrating used these labels eponymously.</p> 
	<p>And, while the modern descriptor “American Sign Language” or “ASL” has only been in use since the 1960s, during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, neither these terms nor any of their associated political connotations existed. The roughly historical equivalent term during that time period would have been “signs” or “the sign language.”</p> 
	<p>Eventually, this reframing of terminology had its second act in the late twentieth century. In an attempt to regain the power of their own labels, the American Deaf community uses “Deaf” (rendered in American Sign Language as DEAF) not as an audiological designation, but a <em>cultural</em> and <em>linguistic</em> identifier, the way a person might self-identify “I am Chinese” or “I am Hispanic.” Indeed, to the casual observer of American Sign Language, the labels ‘deaf’ and its antonym ‘hearing’ are typically taken as commentary on a person’s audiologic ability. However, viewed in the context of contemporary Deaf discourse, ‘deaf’ and ‘hearing’ function as groups or labels.</p> 
	<p>Simply stated, ‘deaf’ is used to refer to ‘those like us’ and those who share our same knowledge and experience — ‘those who are members of our discourse community’; conversely, ‘hearing’ refers to ‘them’ (e.g. ‘not us’) and ‘those who are <em>not</em> members of our discourse community.’ (Parenthetically, both Anne and I have found ourselves schizophrenically included sometimes as DEAF because we share common experience with the community and, yet, in the next breath, we are eschewed as HEARING, or ‘not us,’) Additionally, many world Deaf communities reject the use of ‘hearing impaired,’ viewing it as a pejorative commentary on ability and the intentional reframing of something they do not do. To draw a somewhat asymmetrical analogy, Black people typically do not frame themselves as ‘unable to be white.’</p>
	<p>These distinctions are important because the historical narrative of Deaf Latter-day Saints is not based in a framework of <em>dis</em>ability, or the inability to hear, but instead in the community of <em>ability</em>, or the value of common language and experience.</p>
	
	<h1>Re-centering ‘Deaf Worship’</h2>
	<p>Deafness, especially during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, is often accompanied with the perception that it is a deficit, a <em>lack</em> of ability, and a <em>lack</em> of sense. As long-held Aristotelian ideology — equating the lack of hearing with an inability to learn — was institutionalized by philosophers, educators, and clergy of the nineteenth century, they considered deafness a moral and cognitive constraint. For all the reports and histories of their many abilities and exploits in the arts and technology, (reference) narratives constructed <em>about</em> deaf people of the late 1800s still tinted them as “pathetic,” “ignorant,” “unfortunate,” and “deprived.” (reference)</p>
	<p>Eugenic experiments on Deaf people into the new century ranged from actual bodily experimentation and modification to the legal prohibition of Deaf intermarriage in order to eradicate the condition altogether. Concerning their salvation, Hannah Joyner has written how evangelical Southerners saw deafness in their children and family members as an absolute crushing disability and impediment to a happy life while Douglas Baynton has pointed out that antebellum Deaf education was focused on soul saving and Christian living (Baynton, 1998). In the early Latter-day Saint tradition, church members and leaders reconciled deafness by invoking Biblical admonitions, such as Isaiah 35 and Matthew 11, to “heal” and “cause the...deaf to hear.” Until they were made “whole,” however, Deaf people were considered to be perpetual recipients of charity, and consequently, if divine appeals were successful, instruments to solely glorify God (cf. Matthew 15).</p>
	<p>From <em>their</em> perspective, however, confronted with nonnative versions of worship, Deaf parishioners sought to view and define <em>their</em> relationships with Deity and salvation from their center and not from the periphery of others. In the <em>direct</em> face of this marginalization, Deaf congregations in New York City as well as Victorian Britain thrived when the Deaf experience was placed at the center. Though its first ministers and clergymen were not deaf, they adamantly maintained that the services be</p>
	<blockquote>“conducted in Sign Language .... Reverend Samuel Smith ... promoted the acceptance of Sign Language, against much opposition, arguing that it was a language entitled to respect and dignity in its own right.”</blockquote>
	<p>London’s Saint Saviour’s held its first services for Deaf people in 1873 and Manchester opened the doors to a church for Deaf worshippers a few years later. Similarly, St. Ann’s Church for the Deaf-Mutes in New York City was originally founded as a Bible study class in 1850 and flourished under the rectorship of Dr. Thomas Gallaudet beginning in 1852.</p>
	<p>Morris’ observes this in the framework of a Deaf-centered theology:</p>
	<blockquote>While modern theological traditions such as feminist and black theologies would put experience as the primary source for theology rather than the written word or ‘Word’ as revelation, they are still mostly word-centred in their articulation of that experience and theological reflection on it because it is done almost entirely by hearing people. Theology for Deaf people, as for people in many other contexts, cannot be only about understanding but about moving deeper into relationships with God as a result of life and experience.</blockquote>
	
	<h1>Deaf Latter-day Saint Proto-community Worship Spaces: 1830s–1890s</h1>
	<p>Prior to the last decade of the 19th century, Deaf Latter-day Saint worship spaces, if existent at all, were largely singular, idiosyncratic, and isolated. Between 1830–1890, although they brought with them the various signed languages and educational backgrounds they attained in their countries of origin, Deaf Latter-day Saint pioneers and émigrés were still largely situated within wards, branches, and auxiliary organizations that communicated in a spoken modality. While there are a handful of early Deaf Latter-day Saint conversion, overland pioneer travel, and post-Exodus narratives alongside the much-better-known analogs of their hearing brothers and sisters, they are fewer and far less recognized.</p>
	<p>The earliest-known Deaf Latter-day Saint conversion accounts occur in 1832 and 1835, both defined by the worldviews, actions, and framework of their well-meaning hearing relatives and both terminating with their protagonists never joining fellow Saints — deaf or otherwise — in Utah nor meaningfully contributing to the nascent Deaf Latter-day Saint community. The first and only attempt of a pre-Exodus Deaf temple worship space took place in 1846 but there is no record that the experience was in any way tailored to fit the visual needs of a Deaf participant. And until late 1889, given Latter-day Saint perspectives on marriage and disability, frontier pragmatism, and negative attitudes toward Deaf intermarriage, any marriage or solemnization involving Deaf Latter-day Saints were always to non-deaf spouses; Deaf women in particular were fairly common choices for polygamous families.</p>  
	<p>In essence, without architectural, logistical, operational, or even linguistic subspaces in which to develop and grow, any sort of Deaf Latter-day Saint experience was held out of the starting gate at least by seventy years.</p>
	
	<h1>The Deaf-Mute Sunday School (1892–1917)</h1>
	<p>All of this changed, however, in January 1892, when “...a Sunday School [for students boarding at the school for the Deaf at the University of Deseret,] was organized January 10, 1892, with a membership of eleven boys and sixteen girls....[They] marched to the 19th Ward Relief Society room, Mr. Metcalf [, the School’s non-Mormon superintendent] kindly assisting as interpreter...” Though this initial bellwether event represents the first time dedicated physical worship spaces were used by a Deaf Latter-day Saint congregation, at its outset, this was still a provision <em>for</em> — and not initiated <em>by</em> or <em>of</em> — Deaf parishioners.</p> 
	<p>For the first four years of the Sunday School in Salt Lake City (and for at least the next four years in their new location in Ogden), meetings were nearly totally interpreted by Principal Metcalf and mediated by Assistant Superintendent Laron Pratt, a self-described ‘semi-mute’ <em>Deseret News</em> typesetter and son of Latter-day Saint apostle Orson Pratt. Initially, Deaf students and visitors to the Deaf-Mute Sunday School were not afforded the expected symmetry and parity they might have seen in the worship services of their non-Deaf peers and family.</p>
	<p>Sacramental prayers were spoken vocally while Deaf congregants passively followed along — mediated by others — with the prayer on printed cards. Even as late as 1900, George Q. Cannon visited the Sunday School, and remarked that, after the opening prayer and a hymn,</p>
	<blockquote>“the Sacrament was administered in the usual manner; the mutes being furnished with cards containing the prayers on the bread and water which they attentively followed.”</blockquote>
	<p>Nor, at the opening of the Sunday School, did Deaf students and visitors directly participate in prayers and hymn-singing either, although eventually these were later — albeit passive — provisions:</p>
	<blockquote>“Both the prayer and song are...interpreted as the praying and singing proceeds into the sign language, and the students are greatly interested in the interpretation.”</blockquote>
	<p>As the Sunday School matured, however, Deaf Latter-day Saints began to be empowered in magnifying their own eschatology and priesthood and leadership roles. The plasticity and laboratory of the Deaf-Mute Sunday School allowed Deaf church members to explore their own analogs to the Latter-day Saint experience:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>How do Deaf people lead and conduct meetings?</li>
		<li>What does the sacrament look like when it is blessed in sign language? What is salient in the translation of the ordinance?</li>
		<li>How should Deaf priesthood holders reconcile the Biblical and Latter-day Saint mandate of “laying on of hands” while giving a blessing in a manual language?</li>
		<li>How should Deaf Latter-day Saints incorporate or embrace the broader Mormon tradition of hymnody? How should the genetics of church music — notes, rhythm, tune, meter, lyrics — be represented?</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Originally presented to them in a passive, vicarious, mediated format, Deaf Latter-day Saints, empowered by supportive administrators, reengineered their worship, priesthood ministrations, and service in callings into an active, collaborative, and personally potent experience. 21st century Deaf Latter-day Saints are the beneficiaries of the Sunday School’s quarter-century remarkable experiment in the alignment of their worship spaces, which left a heritage of an organizational structure, the development of members’ personal and spiritual efficacy, patterns of administrative norms, and the School as social sanctuary.</p>
	
	<h1>The L.D.S. Branch for the Deaf Building (1917–1999)</h1>
	<p>The odyssey of the Deaf-Mute Sunday School, then, represented a pioneering shift from Deaf Latter-day Saints having singular and heavily-mediated ecclesiastical experiences. The beginnings of community had begun to form with the creation of the Sunday School, and solidified more with the conversion of the School to the L.D.S. Branch for the Deaf in 1917. The week after the Branch’s founding, Ogden Stake President Thomas B. Evans declared that</p>
	<blockquote>a branch for the deaf was organized in the Ogden Stake, but extending throughout the entire Church; every deaf member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints [sic] is a member of this branch, regardless of where he lives.</blockquote>
	<p>As it neared its end in January 1917, however, the Sunday School, having already initiated its own <em>ritual</em> analogs — the <em>how</em> — to traditional Mormon worship behaviors, next set its sights on the ownership of its <em>physical</em> worship space — the <em>where</em> — and how it could emerge its environment to be conducive to people of a visual and manual comport. Their questions were simple but as yet uncovered: is there such a thing as a Deaf Mormon meetinghouse? How do Deaf Latter-day Saints create analogs to traditional Mormon <em>physical</em> worship places? The realization of these challenges was to be found in the L.D.S. Branch for the Deaf building.</p>
	<p>In 1896 and recently under new management, the Sunday School relocated north from Salt Lake City and began meeting concurrently with the Ogden Fourth Ward, conveniently located a block and a half west of the newly migrated School for the Deaf. The Sunday School was relegated to the gymnasium, where it was determined that an Old Testament tabernacle-like meeting space, defined by portable heavy thick black cotton curtains, could be temporarily fashioned for some of the Fourth Ward’s newest tenants. Despite the inventiveness of carving out a space for the Sunday School members, they felt sequestered and constrained (perhaps, the opposite of ‘worshipful’?) in their new accommodations. The disturbing ambient noise and vibrations caused by traffic in the large room proved to be invasive and, especially in the winter time, prohibitive; the “big heating stove in the center of the big room” notwithstanding, the Sunday School’s dark-curtained grotto offered little respite from the cold during their classes.</p>
	<p>After the Sunday School administration was reconstituted in January 1911, the campaign for a building soon followed. In October 1912, superintendent Max Woodbury and assistant superintendent Elsie Christiansen drafted a letter to Church President Joseph F. Smith “stating the facts of deafness” and the need for a dedicated “place they could come” not only for Sunday School, but also sacrament and Mutual activities. They explained that “[o]n cold days we couldn’t keep warm and one room was never a satisfactory place in which to hold five classes....Another letter followed containing the signatures of many of the older deaf” sustaining the request.</p>
	<p>One week after the letter requesting a dedicated facility was sent to Salt Lake, President Evans met with Woodbury, who, along with Christiansen, was invited to speak privately with President Smith regarding the matter. Upon meeting, President Smith inquired of Woodbury if his father was John Stillman Woodbury; Superintendent Woodbury confirmed that he was indeed. At this news, the prophet recounted that, as a youth he was called to a mission in the Sandwich Islands, where he was met by “a wonderfully kind man [John Stillman Woodbury] who took him by the arm and taught him the language of the Islands and helped him to get settled in the mission.”</p> 
	<p>Either at that meeting, or a second appointment which followed, the First Presidency approved a construction budget of $15,000 whereby the Church would “erect...a suitable place of workshop...solely for the use of the deaf.” Ogden Stake Presidency Second Counselor Thomas E. McKay visited Sunday School closing exercises in November 1913 and announced the plans to build “a new Sunday School for the Deaf.” By April 1914, the Ogden Stake presidency had initiated correspondence with the First Presidency to propose parcels of land for purchase, and by July 1915, ad-hoc “Building Committee” members Woodbury and David John Thurman began to assume administrative responsibilities to move the project forward.</p>
	
	<h2>Architecting A Deaf Latter-day Saint Space</h2>
	<p>In the mid-1870s, church architects across the United States began to field requests from local parishioners on the designs of their worship spaces. Congregations took a heightened interest in the efficacy of their services, fighting the demands of the space to compete for the best seats in order to hear or see their ministers. “Congregations took their demands to accommodate their physical needs to architects, who were increasingly eager to address functional issues in architectural design.”</p>
	<p>Woodbury, Thurman, and — most significantly — other Deaf members of the Sunday School like Christiansen advised renowned Prairie School style architect Leslie Hodgson — also a member of the Ogden Stake High Council and a past visitor to the Sunday School — on design innovations that would best suit a visually-oriented congregation.</p>
	<p>Hodgson was the architect of several other local award-winning Ogden landmarks, including Ogden High School, the Peery Egyptian Theater, numerous private residences, and several local area Latter-day Saint meetinghouses. Hodgson’s aesthetic sense and pragmatism was influenced first during a brief 1905 stint with a Los Angeles-based architectural firm and Frank Lloyd Wright student Irving Gill and then in 1906 by collaborations with fellow Ogden-based architect Julius Smith.</p>
	<p>In the building the Deaf-Mute Sunday School would occupy in 1917, Deaf members seized opportunities to further (re)define how they would shape and occupy their own physical worship and teaching spaces.</p>
	
	<h3>Worship and Administrative Spaces</h3>
	<p>Jeanne Halgren Kilde has noted that, at the end of the nineteenth century, congregations in the United States were not only growing in size but also advancing in class. Evangelical and Protestant faithful intended to wrest power away from a sole singular minister or preacher and “took literally the idea that the church is ‘the people,’ and lay members, both men and women, eagerly shouldered the tasks of church leadership.” As larger crowds assembled for worship services in the 1850s and 1860s, truss-supported open-amphitheatre-style halls or spaces with auditorium seating replaced the flat traditional cruciform spaces — famous for their poor acoustics and blocked sightlines — and removed pillars and columns from obstructed views of the speakers.</p> 
	<p>The Latter-day Saint tradition incorporated these new architectural features as well. Pre-Exodus meetingspaces traditionally housed smaller, fixed crowds where viewing distances were short and amenable; large gatherings were held outside in flat groves and open spaces. The Old Salt Lake Tabernacle, built in 1851, appears to be the first post-Exodus attempt at amphitheatre worship space, “the outside walls...[were] low at ground level, and the earth under the wood floor... [was] excavated to provide a slope for the floor.”</p>
	<p>Amphitheatre seating also made its way into local Mormon meetinghouses, but nowhere was it more needed than in the proposed Chapel for the Deaf space. Likely taking cues from Woodbury, Christiansen, and others, Hodgson designed the chapel at a 1:3.5" pitch, with a central section of ten 85" wide pews flanked by two outside columns of ten 64" wide pews and one 45–47" pew in the rear of each column. Consequently, the rostrum and pulpit, then, could be viewed from any seat in the chapel, an accommodation that would have thrilled a visually-oriented congregation. Late nineteenth-century church architects also noticed another important benefit (especially to a Deaf audience) from this new egalitarian seating arrangement:</p>
	<blockquote>[O]ne excellent result of the Greek disposition of seats, each rising from eight to eighteen inches above the one in front, is not only the free view of the stage, <em>but the opportunity it gives for everyone in the hall to see almost everybody else</em> — the social effect, it may be termed. There is no more valuable adjunct to noble architecture than this sea of interested and sympathetic faces (italics added).</blockquote>
	<p>Their Deaf worship space, they also decided, required natural light, a premium commodity that would augment the already-planned three 250-watt electrical light figures hung from the chapel ceiling. Twelve 20" &#215; 50" inch tall vertical windows on either side of the chapel allowed for maximum lighting into the room, and a clever skylight directly above the pulpit also illuminated the speaker’s space, aiding congregants in viewing a visual liturgy.</p>
	<p>With Deaf members being called to prominent leadership and teaching positions far more commonly after 1911, shaping the chapel’s <em>administrative</em> and <em>liturgical</em> spaces — the rostrum and clerk’s desks — was also an important part of a Deaf Latter-day Saint worship space. Traditional Mormon meetinghouse logistics placed speakers at a high centralized point (a pulpit) while other administrators and visitors were located behind the speaker. Although during the first fifteen years of the Sunday School there was only one Deaf administrator, over the next ten years (as the Sunday School prepared to convert to branch), there would be six Deaf members promoted to leadership positions (Pearl West [1908], Elsie Christiansen [1911], Peter Slot [1911], Elizabeth DeLong [1914], Nephi Larson [1915], and Otto Farley [1917]), not to mention the calling of several Deaf teachers, necessitating a recontexting of seating and ‘sighting’ in the building’s administrative space.</p>
 	<p>Although there is finished semicircular benching behind the pulpit, members of the Deaf Sunday School helped Hodgson to position six narrow benches perpendicular to and in front of the pulpit. This allowed Deaf leaders to participate naturally in liturgy from the pulpit; the 72” pew to the lower right would likely have been reserved for a presidency or bishopric and the other five narrow 38" pews for other speakers or clerks.</p>
	<p>(Parenthetically, I gave a report of my own two-year mission experience in this building in 1992. I recall sitting on the back bench — but not behind the pulpit — to await my turn. I also recall wishing I had had similar architectural features in the wards and branches in which I served. This truly was a singular experience.)</p>
	
	<h3>Teaching Spaces</h3>
	<p>Off to the lower east side of the rostrum was a short split-level staircase which led parishioners either to the outside or the basement. As the Sunday School included five classes — Kindergarten, Primary, First Intermediate, Second Intermediate, and Theological — adequate space was needed to house students; eight classrooms were designed (anecdotally, some have said “squeezed”) into the basement. As with the chapel, light was a necessity in defining this new Deaf pedagogical space. Where Sunday School members remember being placed in darkened makeshift curtained compartments, now they advised Hodgson to not only design accommodating surroundings, but also introduce as much light into the space as possible. The basement level was raised almost 36" above ground level, with six sets of two 22" wide windows on the west and east sides of the building allowing for copious natural light to be brought into the basement.</p>
	<p>Hodgson, of course, also planned electrical features in each classroom, each room with one 110 watt outlet, but, curiously, two light fixtures — one an expected centralized overhead fixture and another (sconce) on the wall just inside the classroom door. Likely, Hodgson was being advised again to incorporate ahead-of-its-time contemporary accommodative technologies into this Deaf worship and teaching space. Early references to flashing electrical lights as assistive technology (e.g., doorbells, baby alarms, alarm clocks) can be found as early as 1914 and became commercially available to Deaf people in the 1920s and 1930s. These “signals,” as Hogdson’s designs called for, were flashing lights used by Sunday School and Branch administrators to indicate beginning and dismissal times of their classes.</p>
	<p>Each of the classrooms were originally fitted with four rows of pews or benches which faced forward, towards the interior walls. In Hodgson’s blueprints, however, an onion skin amendment to the plans indicates that “20 (or 24) chairs instead of benches” should be placed in the room. Deaf and signing teachers in the Sunday School and Branch understood that the classroom environments needed to be arranged such that pupils could see each other as well as line-of-sight to the instructor. Chairs in the classrooms allowed Deaf students to alter their learning spaces in semicircles so as to take advantage of natural visual learning methods.</p>
	<p>All of these architectural features predated the Americans with Disabilities Act by over seventy years and informed the spaces which would forge the logistical, social, and pastoral templates that future units for the Deaf would emulate. In succinct terms, Deaf congregations and classes <em>still use these patterns today</em> in their worship and teaching spaces. Once advanced technologies became available, closed-circuit cameras and television monitors in standard chapels would extend visual access to the speaker, whether congregants were seated in the front-facing pews, anterooms, or behind the podium on the stand.</p>
	
	<h2>Summary and Impact</h2>
	<p>In order to accommodate a more centralized radius of Deaf Latter-day Saints in Weber and neighboring counties, The Ogden Deaf Branch was asked to move from their building in 1999. Members today still mourn the displacement from this historic building. For generations of School for the Deaf students and Ogden Deaf Latter-day Saints, socially and spiritually, this building was their home, their space. Its impact reaches far beyond its local community, however; the Chapel for the Deaf has remained the template for Deaf Latter-day Saint physical worship space in its manipulation of light, expanse, portability and mobility, and logistics. It has conditioned an irreversible expectation of Deaf-led and Deaf-centered services that allow members to exercise priesthood, magnify callings, and raise families.</p>
	<p>Though highly significant, the Deaf-Mute Sunday School and Chapel for the Deaf do not represent the apex of Deaf space creation. Successful in Ogden, other Sunday Schools rooted in this same didactic soon emerged from the newly created family tree: Barnsley, England in 1916; Bountiful, Utah in 1920; Washington, D.C. in the 1930s; Los Angeles in 1941; and Phoenix in the early 1950s. Formalized Deaf Church units were established in Salt Lake in 1948 and Northern and Southern California in the early 1950s. The first-ever dedicated Deaf and signed-language-using ward was formed in 1971; the third and fourth generation of Deaf Latter-day Saints gathered in college towns like Provo; Fremont, California; and Washington, D.C. to build branches which then dispatched missionaries into the field to germinate more classes and new signed language units.</p>
	
	<h1>The Salt Lake Valley Branch for the Deaf Building (1948–1975)</h1>
	<p>One of these new Sunday Schools begin meeting with the Bountiful First Ward by 1919 where there were eight Deaf members of the ward. Comprised mostly of Utah School for the Deaf graduates and other Ogden alumni who lived and worked in Salt Lake City, the Bountiful Deaf Sunday School soared to fifty members by 1920. The Deseret Sunday School Union took a keen interest in this group and formally organized The Sunday School for the Deaf Mutes in September 1920 and “knowing your deep interest in this special field of religious service,” called Willard E. Barlow to be its first — and only — leader.</p>
	<p>Arguably the most traveled unit in the history of the Church, the new Salt Lake-based Sunday School spent its next twenty-eight years couchsurfing, as it were, relocating <em>eleven</em> times to various properties around the city, from the Bureau of Information on Temple Square to the baptistry of the Salt Lake Tabernacle and finally to Brigham Young’s office in the Lion House on South Temple.</p>
	<p>Although discussions were held as early as 1943 to determine if an existing building could be retrofitted for their use, Barlow submitted a request to the First Presidency in August 1947 for a permanent meetingplace and was rewarded with the assignment to immediately procure property and an architect. Groundbreaking for the building was planned for the end of the month, and the project to build the second physical space for Deaf Latter-day Saints was underway.</p> 
	<p>The Salt Lake Sunday School enjoyed a unique relationship with Church administrators; Superintendent Barlow and his counselors did not report up through a traditional local ecclesiastical line, but instead directly to the Church’s Committee on L.D.S. Meetings in Foreign Languages, headed by John A. Widtsoe and staffed by six or seven foreign-born general authorities. This is significant because it notes the Church’s relatively progressive (at least for the time period) perspective on Deafness in the church: although Deaf members were considered “unfortunate people,” they still viewed Deafness as a function of <em>language</em> and not of <em>disability</em>.</p>
	<p>Branch members labored for the next twenty-eight months on <em>their</em> building, digging trenches and, like the L.D.S. Branch for the Deaf before them, envisioning how they would design the interior to leverage the needs of a visual audience. They approached their space differently, attempting to integrate and accommodate the chapel, classrooms, and recreation hall. Their chapel did not leverage auditorium seating (indeed, as enrollment was only 85 at the time, the room was designed to only hold 110 people) but did allow for limited overflow. And, like the Ogden chapel, the room maximized natural light and compensated for the leveled room by placing the speaker on a high rostrum and utilizing a dark curtain directly behind to provide contrast and minimize viewer stress. Unlike the Ogden building, however, the new Branch facility included a wood floor, satisfying the Deaf cultural behavior of creating vibrations on the floor in order to get the attention of others.</p>
	<p>Perhaps greater than any novel architectural addition, however, was the achievement of building a Deaf space <em>by</em> Deaf people. Put another way,</p>
	<blockquote>The type of sacred space ... that Deaf people use suggests that Deaf people want to be involved in liturgy and that they are active participants who need to see what is happening. It also suggests that Deaf people feel free not to follow convention too much, but can arrange their space in a way that meets their needs, pointing to a more positive perspective of Deaf people in the liturgical context.</blockquote>
	
	<h1>The Salt Lake Valley Deaf Ward Building (1977)</h1>
	<p>It didn’t take long for the Branch to outgrow its building. With a maximum chapel capacity of 110 and an overflow of perhaps fifty or sixty, Deaf Branch members who arrived late on Sunday mornings would have had to suffer with terrible sightlines or even no view at all, stuck behind the ‘frame’ of the picture box window at the back of the chapel. At the September 1971 announcement of the Branch’s conversion to the first ever Deaf Ward in the Church, “a large crowd of over 215 filled the chapel <em>and</em> cultural hall,” a unique event that — because there was no closed circuit television or video capture system in place in the chapel — would have likely used relay interpreters to convey the message from the pulpit to an intermediary to an overflow audience out of sight of the chapel. Because of its size, by November 1975, the Ward would be on the move again, temporarily housed in the Emigration Ward meetinghouse in east Salt Lake City.</p>
	<p>As Superintendents Woodbury and Barlow had done previously, Bishop Lloyd Perkins was asked to consult with his stake leaders on how to design their new building to accommodate members of the new Deaf ward. This time, however, although the building would not solely be used by Deaf members, Perkins advocated for several adaptations that would have been familiar to visitors of the Ogden and Salt Lake Branch buildings:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Classrooms should be designed with small, wide windows at the top of the room, to provide natural light, but not to make it difficult to see videos or overhead projections.</li>
		<li>The chapel should have auditorium seating, with the rows in a slight semicircle, to maximize sightlines and give anyone a direct view to the front of the room. (A few years later, technology would be added to project the pulpit on an overhead screen for easier viewing.)</li>
		<li>Pews for ward leaders should be arranged to the front and side of the pulpit to allow for ease of viewing. (Later, a television monitor was placed behind so those sitting on the stand could view the pulpit.)</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Bishop Perkins’ recommendations were initially rejected by Church architects because they felt the suggestions did not correlate with then-standard Church building program features. He enlisted the help of President Spencer W. Kimball; Kimball was familiar with the needs of Deaf people because his Deaf sister-in-law Mary Eyring lived in his home. Kimball asked the building committee to reconsider Perkins’ requests, and the alterations were made.</p> 
	<p>The combinations of sixty-year-old architectural space considerations and added advanced technologies pushed worship and social spaces forward for Deaf Latter-day Saints, now the unquestioned standard. In the Morris’ framework of a Deaf theology,</p>
	<blockquote>it is often the power structures of churches that have left Deaf people on the margins and continue to patronize Deaf people by asking ‘what can we do to help and include them in our church’ rather than empowering Deaf people to be a church in culturally appropriate ways.</blockquote>

	<h1>We’re Done With This, But We’re Not Done Yet</h1>
	<p>While we’ve painted a picture of revolution and achievement, there is still a glacial, regressive aspect of Deaf Latter-day Saint space creation that challenges us.</p>
	<p>The Salt Lake Deaf Sunday School of the 1930s and 1940s enjoyed a unique relationship with Church administrators; Superintendent Barlow and his counselors did not report up through a traditional local ecclesiastical line, but instead directly to the Church’s Committee on L.D.S. Meetings in Foreign Languages, headed by John A. Widtsoe and staffed by six or seven foreign-born general authorities. This is significant because it notes the Church’s relatively progressive (at least for the time period) perspective on Deafness in the church: although Deaf members were considered “unfortunate people,” they still viewed Deafness as a function of <em>language</em> and <em>not</em> of disability.</p>
	<p>Sixty years on, however, the perception of Deaf people in the church has reverted to a center of disability. Administered by the Church’s “Special Services,” there is no ombudsman, no central locus of counsel — or council — for Deaf Saints. Though there is a slightly elevated level of empowerment along the Mormon Corridor, Deaf Saints still incur resistance to their efforts to create worship spaces. There is massive institutional church insistence on correlated worship, handwringing over interpreting provision and the use of ‘approved’ practitioners, and loggerheads over creating new shared spaces for deaf and non-deaf church members — how shall we sing? what language is primary? whose center is marginalized? — while accommodating both. There is the constant struggle for an egalitarian “fellow citizen[ship] with the Saints” (Ephesians 2:19) in temple worship and service.</p>
	<p>The watershed moments and lessons of Deaf Latter-day Saint social, logistical, spiritual, and geographical space creation of the last one hundred and eighty years have proved formative and necessary. We’re done with this, but we’re not done yet</p>
